My final project in web application course

# The main problem that this application came to solve:

On the one hand, quite a few amateur Israeli artists as well as professionals who have difficulty finding a convenient Israeli platform for displaying their works and selling them to art lovers. As an amateur painter I came across quite a bit on the wall when I turned to art galleries where sales and exhibitions take place. An artist who does not sell and does not have protections in galleries, finds it difficult to sell his works in Israel.
On the other hand, there are quite a few art lovers who are interested in encouraging creativity, buying works and giving a stage to artists. But not only them.
The field of interior design is lively and quite a few times the designer is looking for very specific works in size, color and style.

# The main concept of my application to solve this problem:
The app on the part of the artist is a stage for his works. An artist can publish a number of works, give detailed information (date of creation, materials, size of the work, asking price) and even leave contact information for those interested. Beyond that, the artist will be able to see which work is more noticeable, and direct himself to create art in a more desirable style.
On the part of the designer / art lover / buyer, the app will be a dynamic gallery and will contain works by all the artists, including the asking price and details about the work. There will be an option to contact the artist in order to purchase the work or order a work privately.
Target Audience
Sellers - artists, with an emphasis on painters.
Buyers - interior designers, art lovers and buyers - the general public.
